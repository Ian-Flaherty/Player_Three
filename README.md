# LYFE - "changing ideas"

## Overview

LYFE is the App you can say yes or no to movies/photos/recipes/whatever you want. If you like them they are saved into your saved profile for you to look at any time. Down the road I will want to put an algorithim in that can make the experience even better for the user by collecting previous information from liked and disliked to calculate what the user would like to see.
